# Sentiment-analysis

**# Sentiment Analysis Project🎭**

**📌##Overview**

This project focuses on sentiment analysis, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment behind a given text. The goal is to classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral, helping businesses and researchers understand user opinions and feedback.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Python (for data processing & model training)
NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)
Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (for model building)
Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

**📊 Dataset**

Used a dataset containing text reviews, social media comments, or tweets.
Preprocessed data by removing stopwords, tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF or Word2Vec).

**🚀 Implementation Steps**

Data Collection & Cleaning – Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
Feature Engineering – Used TF-IDF, Bag of Words (BoW), or Word Embeddings.
Model Training – Implemented ML classifiers like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers).
Evaluation & Insights – Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization – Displayed sentiment distribution and model accuracy trends.

**🔥 Results & Insights**

The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test data.
Most common words in positive/negative reviews were visualized.
Potential applications include customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and brand reputation management.
